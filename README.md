# Criminal Occurrences Visualization
This tool is intended to create a crime map visualization from a smartphone burglary dataset.

## Technology

- Front-End
    - HTML5
    - CSS3
    - Leaflet.sj

- Back-End
    - Python
    - Pandas
    - Flask

- Dataset
    - The dataset was downloaded from SÃ£o Paulo state open data site.

 ## Usage / Setup
To use the crime_occur_vis, use Linux or Windows, and install the following requirements.

- Latest version: 

- `Apache or Nginx`
- `Python3`
- `pip3`
- `Linux`

Install our requirements:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 01 - Installation

- The tool is divided into two parts: the front-end and the API.

#### A - API

- First, go to the API directory:

    - Change to directory `api/`

- Then run the API with the following python script:

```
python3 api/routes.py
```

 - The API will run in the following address:

```
http://localhost:5000/getoccur?ini_month=Julho&brand=APPLE
```
#### Front-end

- Before opening the visualization in a web-browser check the API address.

- Using your favorite IDE open the following file `index.html`

 - Go to line 46 and change the API address:
 
```
xhttp.open("GET", "http://api.crimevis.work
```

### 02 - Execution

- cd to directory `${ROOT_DIR}/query_proc`

- The following script processes a log file to generate a list of keywords and URLs 
that contains fix recommendations. Dockerfiles located in `${ROOT_DIR}/results/files_to_analyze.log` will be processed.

For example:

```
python3 keyword_creator.py
```

### 03 - Check query results

- Check the output at: 

```
${ROOT_DIR}/results/analyzed_query.json.
```

 - Analyzed query example:

 ```
 {
    "Hash: 154176094": [
        {
            "Log fragment": "E: The repository 'http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu artful-updates Release' does not have a Release file.  E: The repository 'http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu artful-backports Release' does not have a Release file.  \u001b[0mThe command '/bin/sh -c apt-get update -qq -y' returned a non-zero code: 100 ",
            "Query": "ubuntu release a e the repository http archive",
            "URLs": {
                "0": "https://askubuntu.com/questions/1120194/e-the-repository-http-archive-canonical-com-precise-release-is-not-signed",
                "1": "https://askubuntu.com/questions/996718/ubuntu-repository-does-not-have-a-release-file"
            }
        }
    ]
}
 ```

 ## Preliminaries

This repository work is in-flux, at this time there are only a few pre-results. The dataset of Dockerfiles must be in Context to avoid misconfiguration errors. We are using TF-IDF to generate the keywords, first, we tried to use the RAKE algorithm, but we can't get good results.
